your project and edit it directly: wire "Add to cart" to your real cart
state/API in place of the callback here.

Matches Figma "Product Detail". Composed entirely from
components already in this library: ProductGallery, WishlistButton,
StarRating, StockStatus, PriceDisplay, ColorSwatch, SizeSelector,
QuantitySelector, Button, and Divider -- this block is purely layout +
wiring, no new visual primitives of its own (StarRating was the one
piece genuinely missing from the library, since Figma's Star Rating had
no matching component yet -- built alongside this block, not invented
ad hoc inside it, so it's reusable everywhere else a rating shows up).

Color/size selection and quantity are genuinely live, wired state (not
decorative) -- picking a color updates the "Color: {label}" text above
the swatches, same for size, matching Figma's own labeled-row behavior
where the label reflects whatever's currently selected.` } } },
