  parameters: { docs: { description: { component: `A COMPOSITION EXAMPLE, not a configurable component. Copy this file into
your project and edit it directly: wire "Add Item"/wishlist/sort to your
real cart/catalog state in place of the callbacks here.

Matches Figma "Product Grid" (node 1658:29889, 2 states: Default, With
Filters). Composed entirely from existing library components --
SectionHeading (Marketing, the "Shop" eyebrow + title + subtitle --
this block used to build that shape inline before SectionHeading
existed as its own component; now reuses it instead of keeping a
second copy to drift out of sync), Button (the "Sort" control), and
ProductCard (E-commerce set, already covering the card's own image/
rating/price/sale-badge/out-of-stock/swatches/button treatment) -- no
new visual primitives, this block is purely heading + filter bar +
grid layout.

Whether the filter bar (product count + Sort button) renders is a real
layout choice (Figma's "With Filters" style), not something derivable
from the product data -- \`showFilterBar\` stays an explicit prop. The
product COUNT itself, though, is derived from \`products.length\` rather
than a separate manual prop, same "derive from data" reasoning used
throughout this library.

Figma's own two states actually disagree on the grid's gap (8px in
Default, 24px in With Filters) -- a real inconsistency between two
separately-authored example states, not an intentional feature (a
grid's spacing can't sensibly depend on whether a filter bar happens to
render above it). This block uses 8px everywhere, matching Default.

Wishlist and color-swatch selection are real wired state, per card, not
decorative -- ProductCard's \`wishlisted\`/\`colors[].selected\` are
controlled props, so without this the heart and swatches would render
but visibly do nothing when clicked. Keyed by each product's id/name
rather than one shared piece of state, since selecting a color on one
card must never affect another card's own selection.` } } },
