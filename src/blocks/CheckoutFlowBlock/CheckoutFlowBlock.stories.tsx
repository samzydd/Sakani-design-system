your project and edit it directly: wire the form submissions to your
real shipping/payment APIs in place of the simulated flow here.

Matches Figma "Checkout Flow" (2 states: Shipping, Payment) -- both are
really just this block's own \`step\` state at different values, not a
manual style prop, same "derive from data" pattern used throughout this
library. Composed entirely from components already in this library:
CheckoutSteps (E-commerce), Input, Button, Divider, and CartItem
(E-commerce, already wired to the real QuantitySelector) for the order
summary's line item.

CheckoutSteps' own 4 fixed steps (Cart/Shipping/Payment/Confirmation)
cover more ground than this block owns -- Cart and Confirmation are
separate blocks in this same set -- so this block's \`step\` maps onto
CheckoutSteps' \`currentStep\` at index 1 (Shipping) or 2 (Payment) only.

The order summary reflects real, live cart state (quantity changes on
the CartItem actually recompute the subtotal/total below it), not
static numbers -- same reasoning as every other block's demo state
being genuinely wired rather than decorative.` } } },
